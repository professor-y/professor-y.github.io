The first solution: feed all text into col list, render only current page.
Hover button on desktop works fine, yet causes problem on mobile.

1-0: works fine except on mobile. No loading message.

1-1: with Loading message. Removed hover, touch effects, leaving naked transparent buttons.
     good enough for me.

The second approach: render all pages right at the beginning. Easier for page translatex animation.
Maybe later.
